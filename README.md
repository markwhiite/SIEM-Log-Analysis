**Purpose**

- The goal of this project is to practice security monitoring and log analysis using Splunk in a virtual lab.
I configured my virtual machines (Windows, Kali Linux, and OPNsense) to forward logs into Splunk, then created searches, alerts, and dashboards to detect suspicious activity such as port scans, failed logins, and firewall blocks.
This project demonstrates how SIEM tools ingest raw telemetry and help analysts investigate potential threats.


**Tools Used** 
- Splunk
- Windows (Target VM)
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- Sysmon
